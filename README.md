# 👋 Hi there! I'm Bhavana Samboju

I'm a **results-driven Python Automation Developer** and **Data Analyst**, transitioning into **Data Engineering** roles. With 4+ years of experience, I specialize in using **Python** to automate manual workflows, orchestrate ETL pipelines, and integrate with cloud services like **Snowflake** and **AWS**.
I’ve worked on both structured **ETL pipelines** and flexible **data pipelines (ITD)**, using Python as the core and orchestrated with tools like Airflow and AWS Glue to ensure reliability and automation.

My core strength is **Python development**, and I love building smart, scalable solutions that bring efficiency and structure to raw, messy data.
